This code is designed to parse today's news from 5 Southeast Asian websites, sort them by specified keywords and output only 5-10 most relevant ones

The websites are:

  1) Vietnam express https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy (Vietnamese news agency)
  2) The Star https://www.thestar.com.my/ (Malaysian news agency)
  3) Rappler https://www.rappler.com/ (Filippino news agency)
  4) The Straits Times https://www.straitstimes.com/asia (Singaporean news agency)
  5) CNA https://www.channelnewsasia.com/international (another Singaporean news agency)

The Parser parses news sections about politics, economy or society.

The keywords are contained in the main file parser.py and can be changed if needed (they are listed in form of regex expressions).
